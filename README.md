I am currently looking for full time roles in Systems/Computer Architecture including but not limited to Performance modeling and optimisation.
I am cuurently working on a project heavily involving Gem5, cache coherence protocols and NUMA systems.


**WORK EXPERIENCE**

Software Engineer \ August 2020 - August 2021 \
SDE, Cisco \
· Worked on adding security features and fixing software bugs on Cisco IOS-XR. \
· Added new security ciphers and key exchange protocols to CiscoSSH. \
· Added new certificate checking commands and worked on code sanitization. \

Memory profiling and visualisation in Multicore Systems \ January 2020 - May 2020 \
Research Internship, Multicore Lab, University of Waterloo \
· Created tools to make concurrent programming easier. \
· Can help programmers optimize memory layout to improve performance. \
· Can expose negative interactions between software and operating system, hardware. \
· Shows time series memory usage of program. \
· Meant to be shipped as an end to end workchain providing both libraries as well as scripts for analysis
  with minimal test code change. \

Automatic Video Analysis and display of Contextual Information \ May 2019 - July 2019 \
Summer Intern, Sling Media \
· Designed and implemented an entire automated video insight generation and management system. \
· Designed a GUI to render video insights like celebrity faces, keywords, topics, brands and labels as they
appear on video. \
· Insight management system is highly modularized. Modules are responsible for uploading video to
  insight gathering system, download of insights in JSON, dumping insights into document based DB
  and video playback module. \

Weather Balloon Data Management and Visualisation \ May 2018 - July 2018 \
Summer Intern, Regional Remote Sensing Centre \
· Worked on interactive weather balloon data visualization using Cesium.JS 3D globe and map
visualisation library, KML and CZML. \
· Achieved intuitive visualization of temperature, humidity, wind vectors and pressure gradients of
the balloons in a 3D rendering. \
· Integrated animation of balloon rising along path in 1st person (inside the balloon) and 3rd person
(external view) along with a virtual reality viewing option. \

**PROJECTS**

Speeding up Concurrent Algorithms by exposing multicore architecture to concurrent
programmers \ August 2022 - current \
Masters Thesis, Multicore Lab (sup. by Prof. Trevor Brown) \
· Currently working on optimisation of cache coherency algorithms with special emphasis on NUMA
systems and performance evaluation. \
· Using Gem5, a versatile architecture simulator to model large multicore machines and distributed L2
banks. \
· Exposing hardware functionality to programmer by means of new instructions \

gRPC and FUSE based Network File System \ August 2021 - December 2021 \
Course Project, Distributed Systems \
· Built a user space filesystem using libFUSE. Network communication was achieved through gRPC calls. \
· Implemented optimisations such as batch writes and commit using server and client side caching. \
· Implemented crash recovery in case of network irregularities. \
